    <h2>How to make Adoobo</h2>
    <p>Making Adobo can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. <br> You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon GOYA® Adobo All-Purpose Seasoning with Pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons GOYA® Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Mix chili powder, adobo seasoning, cumin, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl until well combined.<br> Add olive oil and stir until completely saturated.</li>
        <li>Pat pork dry with paper towels. Rub pork all over with spice mixture, then place into the prepared roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated oven until pork is dark golden brown, about 35 minutes. <br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve with accumulated juices.</li>
